# ISMIN_Prototype_Project
This project is the development of a prototype of an Air Guitar. This project was developed during the prototyping discipline of the microelectronics and informatics course at the Ã‰cole des Mines de Saint-Etienne - ISMIN.
The STM32F301K8T6 microcontroller was used to capture the frequency coming from the conditioning circuit to output a PWM frequency which corresponds to a musical note based on buttons pressed in order to simulate a guitar.
